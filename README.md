The repository is organized as follows:

- **/dist**: Contains the transpiled .js files of the project.
- **/resources**: Contains non-source files, such as jsons or csv, from the project.
- **/src**: Contains the source code of the project.
- **/test**: Contains the code of the project tests.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose.
- Git

### Steps

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone git@github.com:marcpardofernandez/node-express-clean-template.git
```

2. Navigate to the root directory of the project:

```
cd node-express-clean-template
```

3. Build and start the Docker containers using Docker Compose:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

4. After the containers are up and running, The application will be fired on `http://localhost:3000`.

5. To stop the application and shut down the Docker containers, run:

```
docker-compose down
```

6. If you also want to remove the volumes (e.g., to reset the database), use:

```
docker-compose down -v
```

7. To execute tests locally use:

```
npm run test
```

## Technology

### NodeJs

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code server-side. It's built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and provides an event-driven architecture that makes it lightweight and efficient for building scalable network applications.

### Express

Express is a minimalist web application framework for Node.js. It provides a robust set of features for building web applications. With a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware at your disposal, creating a robust API is quick and easy.

### Typescript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to the language. It enables developers to write safer and more maintainable code by catching errors at compile-time rather than runtime.

### Brandi

Brandi is a dependency injection container powered by TypeScript.

### MongoDB

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented data model. It's designed to be scalable and flexible, making it well-suited for a wide range of applications.

### Mongoose

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model your application data. Mongoose's schema definition allows you to define the structure of your data, enforce validation, and build complex queries easily.
